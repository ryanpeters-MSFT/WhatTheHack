# Challenge 07 - Service Mesh

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-06.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-08.md)

## Introduction

This challenge will cover the implementation of a service mesh technology.

## Description

You need to fulfill these requirements to complete this challenge:

- Implement inter-container TLS encryption by leveraging a service mesh.

Consider whether your chosen service mesh is compatible with the ingress configuration from Challenge 2.

**Advanced (optional):** Explore sidecarless mTLS using Azure Kubernetes Application Network (preview) on a separate supported public AKS cluster; private clusters are not currently supported.

## Success Criteria

- The application is fully functional
- Traffic between application components (ingress controller to web, and web to api) is encrypted with TLS
